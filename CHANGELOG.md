# Changelog

## 1.3.11

- Make `guard.resource_sha256` mandatory for `guarded_stage`.
- Compute SHA-256 from the current `guard.resource_path` bytes and fail closed on a missing,
  malformed, or mismatched digest.
- Normalize a verified digest to lowercase, return it from guarded stage/commit, and persist it
  in the project-local one-time checkpoint ledger.
- Document that guarded commit attempts its terminal action once and that confirmation proof
  must be collected separately without automatically retrying that action.
